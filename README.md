# fintrust
I just finished a front-end course (excluding frontend libaries) and i will be replicating a fintech website i saw on a figma design. I will be documenting my progress via this readme file. The Frontend will be using vanilla javscript, vanilla css (no framwork) and html. Backend will be written in django. I might later rewrite the backend in node js and use typescript and react for the frontend.

Note: This is for learing purpose only !!!!!
